#ATtiny85 MIDI player
Standalone polyphonic MIDI playback using the PLL and a bunch of software timers. The MIDI file needs pre-parsing into a more dense format to fit into the 8kB of flash. The online conversion tool is [here](https://mitxela.com/other/avr/MidiConverter4.htm) which uses code from jasmid.
